The functionality of this application shall:

1. As input: slimmed down shopping list. The client will be entering the items they buy weekly, and any other necessities.
a. any dietary restrictions.
b. The foods they enjoy and/or not enjoy

2. The application will search a recipe database, and put together an effecient shopping list by using the user's input.
Effecient here means to use as many of the purchased ingredients as possible throughout the week while maintaining a healthy diet. 


3. It would be nice to somehow figure out what ingredients are available and where. For the first version the application will rely on 
a limited set of ingredients that are common items throughout a given country/state/area/place. 

Output: a shopping list of ingredients as well as recipes that make use of those ingredients


Will use Recipe Puppy for searching recpies
Still need a way to gather the amount of ingredients used. Recipe Puppy only returns recipe URL and list of
items. For now we will simply return recipes that use similar ingredients; the more ingredients recipes have in common
the better
